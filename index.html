        <h1>Evan's Music Library</h1>
        <p>The following tracks were made with the intent to be used in my Minecraft mod, Demons and Dreams. I plan to one day release them in an album titled "Demons of the Past".</p>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Storm on the Starry Sea</h2>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Storm on the Starry Sea.wav" type="audio/wav">

            <p>When I started working on this track, I intended it to play in a mysterious region with a dark undertone, but it eventually expanded into its own track that told its own story. It is now a music disc in-game.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Mental Mire</h2>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Mental Mire.wav" type="audio/wav">

            </audio>
            <p>I intended this track to evoke a sense of unease, echoing the insanity that it is meant to encompass. Though the day is usually safe, once the shadows begin to darken, the player hears this and realizes that danger is closer than it appears.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Mire Mental</h2>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Mire Mental.wav" type="audio/wav">

            </audio>
            <p>Given that Mental Mire used reversed instruments quite heavily, I wanted to hear what the whole track sounded like in reverse, and it turned out fairly well.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Fateful Approach</h2>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Fateful Approach.wav" type="audio/wav">

            </audio>
            <p>The player approaches the dragon that stole fate, and this track accompanies them. The track is almost wholly composed of the primary antagonist's main motif.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Echoes of Doom</h2>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Echoes of Doom.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

            </audio>
            <p>This track was intended to play while the player is being pursued by an invincible entity, but I might instead repurpose it for a music disc like I did with "Storm on the Starry Sea".</p>
