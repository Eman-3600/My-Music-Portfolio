            <p>This is the original version of "the Weight of Your Demons". It was one of my first ever tracks and didn't quite strike the tones I wanted, so I've decided to remake it. The chorus here is the Angel motif, which I repurposed in the new version.</p>

            <p>Another one of my first tracks, "So the Moon Cried Out" has a few issues that have led to it being replaced by "Against the Dreadful Night".</p>
