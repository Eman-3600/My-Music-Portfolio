            <p>That place you see in the background? This is what is meant to play there. The current version works, but I feel that there is more I could add. It utilizes a distorted version of the Angel motif to make the player uneasy.</p>

            <h2>The Weight of Your Demons v2</h2>

            <p>This theme still needs a bit of work but is mostly finished. It is meant to play during the first boss fight, which is against the main antagonist of the mod.</p>

            <h2>No Survivors</h2>

            <p>This track is still heavily in development. It is meant to play during the fight against the dragon and features two phases. As the dragon is heavily associated with death, the track frequently uses associated motifs.</p>

        <section class="audio-track">
            <h2>Against the Dreadful Night</h2>
            <audio controls>

            <p>This track accompanies the Dread Moon, an event that occasionally plagues the night. A single night is about 9 minutes long, and this track is not finished until it can meet that length.</p>
